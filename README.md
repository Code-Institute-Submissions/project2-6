      FARM SHOP

   Objective of the site:
   
   The objective of this project was to create a mockup website. I originally created this website for
   my first project but have incorporated it into my second project.
   
   I chose to create a website for a fictitious farm shop. 
   
   About THE SITE:
   
   UX:
   The site contains a description of the farm shop and its owners, the products that they sell and 
   a pair of join me and login modals. As yet, these modals are not operational and are purely aesthetic.
   
   For the second project I'm adding a fully functional contact us section as well as a maps function 
   that will contain a store locator.  
   
   For the maps section it was necessary to set up a google account and get an API key to allow me 
   use google maps.
   
   
   
   
   FEATURES:
   
   The contact us facility allows the site owner to be contacted through a 3rd party(emailjs.com) by potential clients.
   It supplies a portal for the client to register a query via a message while also leaving their contact details(name,
   phone number and email address).
   
   The maps function provides a store locator that enables the clients to find the nearest farm shop to them. It also gives them 
   details of the opening times for each particular shop. 
   
   The bulk of the code for the map facility is in the maps.js file in the js folder(assets/js/mas.js).
   It deals with the location of the map window(ie country/area displayed in the maps portal) by way of lattitude
   and longitude as well as the zoom level of the maps portal.
   It also creates markers and sets each of their positions with regard to each store location. This provides the user with the
   location and opening times of each store in a text box below the map when each marker is clicked.
   
   The code for the layout of the contact me function is in both the about.html and sendEmail.js files. The about.html
   file covers the layout and number of text boxes involved while the sendEmail.js file covers the level of functionality.
   
   
   Technologies Used:
   
   This site was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. Various libraries were used including jQuery which 
   is a JavaScript library that is small and feature rich and more impotantly QUICK...which reduces/eliminates 
   latency or lagging while browsing the site. 
   Another prominent tool used in this project was Bootstrap. This is a front-end framework for designing websites
   and contains HTML and CSS templates that provide a quick method for producing interface components like forms and 
   buttons.
   I also made use of google fonts.
   
   
   Testing:
   
   I ran into some problems while building this site. Positioning the map and contact section took an amount of 
   adjustment before I was happy with the layout
